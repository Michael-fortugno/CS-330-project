# CS-330-project
For this 3D scene I used the tools avalible in OpenGL
like a variety of different shapes and textures
I implemented some code to interact with the scene
like moving the camera around and zooming in on the scene
This was a learning experience for me as it is the first time
I have really used OpenGL and how it works 
OpenGL is a skill that I can build on in the future to help me
become a better coder overall and learn more about what OpenGL can do.
Iterating factor played a big role in developing my scene as it
was a lot of trial and error particulary with lighting my scene
which I was not able to get what I was exepcting from my lighting
so it is a work in progress still.
I tried to use tactics I read about in the resources and prior assignments 
to help me with my scene. I looked at the code base inside learn OpenGL resource
to see how it compares to my code base and how I can integrate what I learn into
my code. The milestone througout the course helped me greatly to complete my
scene. Computational graphics and visulaizations can help me greatly in my future educational and professional 
path. As a computer science major these are skills I will need in the future. I will continue to grow my
skills through practice and this can help me through the rest of my education and help me develop skills
that I can apply professionally in the future.
